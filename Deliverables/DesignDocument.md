# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements

# High level design 

We choose the MVC pattern
<report package diagram>

```plantuml
@startuml

note "Architecture \nIt is a stand alone application \nThe architectural pattern used is MVC \nWe have 2 layers, as show in the diagram" as N1


package "GUI" {
  
}
package "Model And Application Logic" {
  
}

# Low level design

# Verification Traceability Matrix

for each functional requirement from the requirement document, list which classes concur to implement it

# Verification sequence diagrams 
\<select key scenarios from the requirement document. For each of them define a sequence diagram showing that the scenario can be implemented by the classes and methods in the design>
