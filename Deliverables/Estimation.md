# Estimate by Product Decomposition

|                                        | Estimate |
| -------------------------------------- | :------: |
| Number of Classes           (#Classes) |    15    |

| Estimated Effort                  (PH) |   270    |
| Estimated Cost                     (€) |  8'100   |
