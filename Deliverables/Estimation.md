# Estimation approach
<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>
# Estimate by Product Decomposition

|                         | Estimate |    Unit     |
| :---------------------- | :------: | :---------: |
| Number of Classes       |    15    |  #Classes   |
| Avereage Class Size     |   180    |     LOC     |
| Esitimated Project Size |   2700   |     LOC     |
| Estimated Effort        |   270    | PersonHours |
| Estimated Cost          |  8'100   |      €      |
| Estimated Time          |    2     |    Weeks    |
